### Article 1
 -  Article name.
    - Making Better Use of Health Care Data

-  Reference or article citation.
    - https://hbr.org/2018/03/making-better-use-of-health-care-data

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
    - How to use patient history and information to provide better health care

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
    - This data, while helpful, could also be used against patients as a bias for certain treatments.  Or if their data is leaked,
    businesses could hold this data above their heads and decline to offer them certain services due to health care history.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
    - Personal Health Care Data

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
    - The data that can be gathered from patients can be used to help predict future care, and current care.  Such as when a
    diabetic patient may incur a costly and unwanted visit to the hospital.  An AI was able to predict this data with 80% accuracy 

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
    - The patients stand to possibly lose something, as well as the institution that initialized this form of data use.  Shady businesses stand to gain.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
    - Only 17% Of Consumers Believe Personalized Ads Are Ethical, Survey Says

-  Reference or article citation.
    * https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/02/09/83-of-consumers-believe-personalized-ads-are-morally-wrong-survey-says/#10fda53b19f5

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
    - A majority of the population surveyed don't think that personalized ads are very ethical or morally correct

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
    - The use of personal data and how the ads are determined per person. I.E. browser cookies, search history trends, etc.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
    - Personal browser data and search history data

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
    - This analysis tells us that many people do not like the idea of big companies using thier data to cater ads towards them in hopes of getting
    them to buy something.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
    - The big companies stand to gain some marginal profits from these ads, but other than that there is not much at stake for those the ads are personalized
    for.  Perhaps some of their search history could be very questionable and look bad to some employers, but other than that there is not veyr much at stake
    other than a few sales that the consumer may be interested in.
